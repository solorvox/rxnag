# ðŸ’Š RxNag - Medication Reminder

A very lightweight off-line application to nag you when it is time to take your medications.  It is 100% free and open source. (GPL-3)

## Requirements

You need Python3, PyQt5, and PyGame. (PyGame is for audio playback).

On Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Debian, etc. (Python3 should already be installed)

```apt install python3 python3-pyqt5 python3-pygame```

## Installation

### From github
Using git:
```git clone https://github.com/solorvox/rxnag```

Launching RxNag options:

1. Command line:  ```cd rxnag && ./rxnag.py```
2. File manager, navigate to the rxnag folder and double click ```rxnag.py``` then select run

It is possible to set RxNag to auto run when you login.  For example, in Linux Mint use **Mint Menu -> Startup Applications** then select the **[+]** icon. (plus)

Select **Custom Command** then the **Browse** button on the command line.  After selecting ```rxnag.py``` and anything you like for name/description, you can then **Add**.

Binary/flatpak/Windows versions are "Coming soon &tm;"

## Usage
Add your medications, set their dose _interval_. (how often you take them) When you get a notification message simply click on the tray icon and then click the **[Mark taken]** button."  

These notifications will continue every _notification interval_. (default 5 minutes)  

You can **Mute** notifications to disable them per-medication.  While muted they will still be tracked when taken.

* Notification volume [Default 75%]
* Start minimized - Start the application minimized to system tray.  (can also use `--minimized` argument)

Configuration and all data are only stored in your home folder.
